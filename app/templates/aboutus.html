            <p class="lead">We're team 1+A2I and this is our work for Oxford Hackathon 2017! Over here are just some
                possible implementations using a few of APIs by Microsoft Cognitive Services API.
                Most of the code was done in python, with a bit of HTML and Javascript for good measure.
            </p>
            <p class="lead"><b>EmotionWrite</b> was made using a mix of the new Emotion API by Microsoft and standard Python
            packages</p>

            <p class="lead"><b>KeepAwake</b> was made using the Custom Vision API trained on the Marcelo data set (one of our
            team mates) to identify if the user is sleeping</p>

            <p class="lead"><b>HardwareInterface</b> was made using the Face API to receive pose estimates that are used to
            control an Arduino over serial. Possibilities are endless!</p>
